# careerlane_project
An e-learning platform developed using Django. Given a career name, it fetches all the skills set videos of that career from youtube in a sequential form. For Frontend, I used HTML, CSS and JS whereas for backend, I used Django and PostgreSQL. In case, there are multiple videos with same name, my tool will filter the videos based on views, likes and comments. To get the metadata of youtube videos, I used a module named pafy.
